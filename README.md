+ Project summary: In our changing climate, predicting the frequency and magnitude of hurricanes is an ongoing challenge. Understanding past trends is difficult, largely because of changes in tracking quality through the years (most notably improved by the advent of satelitte technology) and discrepancies in measurement and reporting between different countries surrounding the North Atlantic basin.
There are a wide range of environmental conditions that create favorable conditions for hurricanes, including weak vertical wind shear, high humidity in the troposphere, warm sea surface temperatures (SST's), and large background vorticities. In this project, we examine the relationship between some of these factors and the destruction caused by the consequent storms.
